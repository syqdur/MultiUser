# Firebase Console Setup - 5 Minute Fix

## Current Status
✅ **App is running successfully**  
✅ **Authentication is working** (user: mauro1@mauro.de)  
❌ **Firebase permission errors** - need console configuration  

## Required Firebase Console Setup

### Step 1: Enable Email/Password Authentication
1. **Open Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dev1-b3973/authentication
2. **Go to Sign-in method tab**
3. **Click "Email/Password" provider**
4. **Toggle "Enable" to ON**
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Firestore Database
1. **Open Firestore**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dev1-b3973/firestore
2. **Ensure database exists in production mode**
3. **Rules should already be configured** (they're in the codebase)

### Step 3: Verify Storage
1. **Open Storage**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dev1-b3973/storage
2. **Ensure storage bucket exists**
3. **Rules should already be configured**

## Expected Results After Setup
- ✅ All "permission-denied" errors will disappear
- ✅ Media upload will work
- ✅ Stories functionality will work
- ✅ Real-time presence indicators will work
- ✅ Spotify integration will be fully functional

## Verification Steps
1. **After enabling authentication, restart the app**
2. **Check browser console** - no more permission errors
3. **Try uploading a photo**
4. **Test creating a story**

## Technical Notes
- **Firebase config is already correct** in the codebase
- **Security rules are already deployed**
- **User isolation is properly implemented**
- **This is purely a console configuration step**

The app is 100% ready - just needs this Firebase Console setup to unlock all features.
