## Overview

This is a full-stack wedding gallery web application built with React and Express. The application provides an Instagram-style interface for wedding guests to share photos, videos, and messages. It features real-time functionality, Spotify integration for music wishlists, and comprehensive admin controls.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack TypeScript architecture with:

- **Frontend**: React with Vite for fast development and building
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configured but using memory storage currently)
- **Real-time Data**: Firebase Firestore for live updates
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for media files
- **External APIs**: Spotify Web API for music features
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit integration** with automatic module detection
- **Vite dev server** with HMR and runtime error overlay
- **PostgreSQL 16** module for database functionality
- **Port 5000** for the development server

### Production Build
- **Vite build** process generates optimized static files
- **esbuild** bundles the Express server for production
- **Autoscale deployment** target for dynamic scaling
- **Static file serving** from built assets

### Environment Configuration

## Development Roadmap

### Sprint Plan (Multi-User Platform Evolution)
1. **Sprint 01**: Auth-MVP + PrivateRoute (Signup, Login, Logout UI, Firestore users, /gallery/:uid private route)
2. **Sprint 02**: Gallery-Isolation (Firestore galleries doc, default gallery view)  
3. **Sprint 03**: Media-Upload (Drag & Drop → Storage /users/{uid}/..., Firestore media entry)
4. **Sprint 04**: Spotify-pro-User (OAuth flow per user, token save, gallery embedding)
5. **Sprint 05**: Stories (24h expiration logic, UI carousel)
6. **Sprint 06**: Recap-Generator (Selection wizard, render pipeline)
7. **Sprint 07**: Public Gallery + Password Protection (Toggle in galleries doc, public route /p/:uid)
8. **Sprint 08**: Admin-Panel & CI/CD (User overview, storage management)

### Current Status: Sprint 08 Complete - Full Production Ready

**Implementation**: Sprint 01-08 complete with all acceptance criteria fulfilled
**Features**: Stories, Recap Generator, Public Galleries, Advanced Admin Panel all functional
