# Firebase Authentication Setup Required

## Issue
Firebase Error: auth/operation-not-allowed - Email/password authentication is not enabled.

## Required Steps in Firebase Console

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select your project**: dev1-b3973
3. **Navigate to Authentication**:
   - Click "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Go to "Sign-in method" tab
4. **Enable Email/Password Authentication**:
   - Find "Email/Password" in the sign-in providers list
   - Click on it
   - Toggle "Enable" to ON
   - Click "Save"

## Additional Recommended Setup

5. **Configure Authorized Domains** (if needed):
   - In the same "Sign-in method" tab
   - Scroll down to "Authorized domains"
   - Add your Replit domain if not already present

6. **Set up Firestore Security Rules**:
   - Go to "Firestore Database" â†’ "Rules"
   - Update rules to allow authenticated users access to their own data

## After Setup
Once email/password authentication is enabled, users will be able to:
- Create accounts with email and password
- Sign in to their personal gallery
- Access user-isolated data and media

The authentication system is fully implemented and ready to work once this Firebase configuration is completed.
