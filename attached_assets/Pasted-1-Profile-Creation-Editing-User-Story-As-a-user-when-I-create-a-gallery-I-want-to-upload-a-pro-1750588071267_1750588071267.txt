1. Profile Creation & Editing
User Story:
As a user, when I create a gallery, I want to upload a profile picture, define my profile name, and write a short bio, so my gallery has a personal touch.

Acceptance Criteria:

On first gallery creation, show a profile setup modal:

Upload profile picture (JPEG, PNG – preview required).

Input for profile name (required).

Textarea for short bio (max 300 chars).

These settings are saved to the user profile.

Profile settings can be edited later in the Admin Panel > Edit Profile section.

Inputs are validated and persisted (including image storage).

2. Theming System (Templates)
User Story:
As a user, I want to choose from predefined gallery themes (Wedding, Vacation, Birthday) with specific text and color stylings, so the gallery fits the event.

Acceptance Criteria:

Allow the user to select a theme at gallery creation and change it later in Admin Panel.

Implement the following templates:

Theme	Color Theme	Text Content Variant
Wedding	Romantic tones (e.g., soft pinks, ivory)	Already implemented
Vacation	Soft green, pastel tones	Relaxed, joyful vacation messaging
Birthday	Light blue with festive highlights	Cheerful birthday text prompts

The selected theme should:

Change the gallery’s CSS color variables.

Change headline texts and section prompts to match theme tone.

Theme must be saved and persist on reload.

3. Editable Notes System
User Story:
As a user, I want to edit notes in the gallery so I can personalize messages for each memory or moment.

Acceptance Criteria:

Notes can be edited inline (click to edit or pencil icon).

Current implementation does not persist changes (no backend connection yet).

Future TODO: Add save-to-database logic.

Notes field should still be responsive and user-friendly.

4. Profile Name Synchronization in Gallery Posts
User Story:
As a user, when I change my profile name, I want all my gallery posts to reflect the new name automatically.

Acceptance Criteria:

When profile name is updated and saved in Admin Panel:

All instances in the gallery where the profile name appears (e.g., post attribution, comments, etc.) are updated immediately.

Profile name is referenced dynamically, not statically stored in posts.

Ensure update happens reactively (e.g., through a state management system or DB query).
