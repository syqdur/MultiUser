# Firebase Rules Deployment Required

## Current Issue
Email/Password authentication is enabled, but Firestore security rules need to be deployed to Firebase.

## Manual Deployment Steps
Since we can't authenticate in this environment, you'll need to deploy the rules manually:

1. **Install Firebase CLI locally** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Deploy the rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
   ```

## Alternative: Deploy via Firebase Console

### Firestore Rules
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dev1-b3973/firestore/rules
2. Replace the existing rules with the content from `firestore.rules`
3. Click "Publish"

### Storage Rules  
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dev1-b3973/storage/rules
2. Replace the existing rules with the content from `storage.rules`
3. Click "Publish"

## Expected Result
After deploying the rules, all permission errors will disappear and the app will function fully.
