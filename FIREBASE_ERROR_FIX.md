# Firebase Internal Assertion Error - Fixed

## Issue
Firestore was throwing internal assertion failures due to missing security rules deployment.

## Solution Applied
1. **Error Handling Service**: Created `errorHandler.ts` to safely wrap Firebase operations
2. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working with local state when Firebase fails
3. **User Feedback**: Clear messaging when operations fail due to missing rules

## Components Updated
- `ProfileHeader.tsx`: Safe profile loading and saving
- `LiveUserIndicator.tsx`: Protected live user subscriptions
- Error boundaries prevent app crashes

## Next Steps
Deploy Firebase rules to eliminate these errors:
1. Copy rules from `firestore.rules` to Firebase Console
2. Deploy via Firebase Console or CLI
3. All errors will resolve automatically

## Current Status
✅ App works without crashes
✅ Profile editing functions locally
⚠️ Data persistence requires rule deployment
