## Technical Debt & Optimizations

### Current Issues
1. **Collection Structure**: Mix of `user_media` global collection and user-specific subcollections
2. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across services
3. **Loading States**: Some components lack proper loading indicators
4. **Type Safety**: Some TypeScript interfaces could be more strict

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Consistent Data Model**: Standardize on user-specific subcollections
2. **Error Boundaries**: Implement React error boundaries
3. **Performance**: Add lazy loading for large galleries
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
5. **Monitoring**: Implement application monitoring

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Immediate**: Complete Sprint 03 media upload enhancements
2. **Short-term**: Implement public gallery features (Sprint 07)
3. **Medium-term**: Add recap generator (Sprint 06)
4. **Long-term**: Build comprehensive admin panel (Sprint 08)
